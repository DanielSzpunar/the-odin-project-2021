Notes: 
  flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.

  flex-grow: expects a single number as it’s value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”.

  flex-shrink: The default shrink factor is flex-shrink: 1, which means all items will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;. You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal.
